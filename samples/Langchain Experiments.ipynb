      "- Round-robin approach: The Load Balancer distributes incoming requests equally across all available instances of the service components.\n",
      "- Weighted approach: The Load Balancer distributes incoming requests based on the weight assigned to each instance of the service components. The weight can be based on the capacity of the instance or any other relevant factor.\n",
      "- Least connections approach: The Load Balancer distributes incoming requests to the instance with the least number of active connections.\n",
